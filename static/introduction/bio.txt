My name is Harry, A computer science students with minor stream Artificial Intelligence and has been working as a Software Engineer Backend around 7 years.
Backend Development has become my specialization, but I do fine working as Cloud / DevOps Engineer / Site Reliability Engineer where focusing on building
applications with following scalability, reliability and 12 factor apps principles. Writing code has become my passion since the moment I tried to build my own console space shooting games
with applying core programming principles, design pattern and software engineering practices on my 2nd semester.


Currently I'm interest learning and back to studying topics related with the Cloud Computing and Generative AI, eager to explore how these technologies can further enhance backend engineering
and open new doors in intelligent systems development.
